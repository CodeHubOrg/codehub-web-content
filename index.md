## Is Codehub for you?

Codehub aims to support anyone with an interest in programming and web development in advancing their skills and knowledge. Whether you are an experienced developer or just learning to code, interested in design or programming, you are more than welcome.

Become a mentor or find one, collaborate with others, work through a course or tutorial - or just have fun working on a side project!

Please check out our [Code of Conduct](%base_url%/code-conduct/).

## What is happening at Codehub?

We run events (Hack nights, Dojos, workshops), organise mentorships and facilitate study groups. Find more information on our activities on the [Codehub Wiki](https://wiki.codehub.org.uk).

We also have a [Slack group](http://slack.codehub.org.uk) where we exchange interesting links and news, and where you can find help when you are stuck with a programming problem.

## Where and when do we meet?

* Bristol Hack Night takes place once a fortnight (Tuesday evenings) at [Framework Co-working](https://www.frameworkbristol.co.uk/) space at 35 King Street. This is also when the Haskell Study group meets, and we currently have a team from Women's Tech Hub working on a website for a charity together.
* WebDev101 once a fortnight (Tuesday mornings) at [Dom's Coffee House](https://domscoffeehouse.co.uk/) near the Hippodrome.
* We run a Python Dojo roughly every month (at Framework) and ocasionally do workshops - these happen at varying venues. You can find more details on our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/codehub-bristol).
