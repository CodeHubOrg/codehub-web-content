## What is happening at CodeHub?

Currently, we are running the following events and activities:
- **Bristol Hack Night** is a casual social coding event where people of any experience can come together to work on projects and learn new skills.  It takes place once a fortnight (Tuesday evenings) at [Framework Co-working space](https://www.frameworkbristol.co.uk/) at 35 King Street.
- **WebDev101** is a self-directed study group for everyone interested in improving their knowledge of web development. It meets once a fortnight (Tuesday mornings) at [Dom's Coffee House](https://domscoffeehouse.co.uk/) near the Hippodrome.
- **Python Dojo** is a safe place to practise and develop coding skills, and perhaps learn something new too.  It is held roughly every month (at Framework).
- **Talks** are organised from time to time, based on feedback from members about topics of interest.
- **Mentoring programme:** we organise mentoring programmes which start approximately twice a year for those interested in joining - either as mentors or as mentees.

All events are advertised and can be joined via our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/codehub-bristol). Please check out our [Code of Conduct](/code-conduct/).

We also have a [Slack group](http://slack.codehub.org.uk) where we exchange interesting links and news, and where you can find help when you are stuck with a programming problem.

We rely on the support of sponsors - without them we would not be able to offer learning and support. We are extremely grateful for their investment - it helps to to create a thriving, diverse and welcoming tech community in Bristol. Please see [our sponsoring page](/sponsoring/) for more information.
