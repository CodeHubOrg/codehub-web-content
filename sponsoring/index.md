## Why support us
We create opportunities for local developers to learn and exchange ideas across different technologies and experience levels. Our activities help our members to:
* Learn new technical skills
* Give newcomers the chance to speak to, and learn from, experienced developers
* Discuss technical problems with their peers
* Foster team working abilities
* Build self-reliance and motivation
* Find out about emerging technologies or opportunities

## Corporate sponsorship
* Support us with a regular sponsorship to cover ongoing expenses, eg admin costs and learning materials.
* Sponsor a single event by meeting the cost of pizzas and refreshments or providing a venue
In return, we will highlight your support to our members and, for regular contributors, will feature your logo and support prominently on our website and in communications with members (eg Meetup invitations). We can also alert members to job openings.


If you’d like to explore these, or other, options we’d be delighted to discuss them further with you.  Please contact us on [info@codehub.org.uk](mailto:info@codehub.org.uk).
