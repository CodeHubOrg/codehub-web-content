  <h2>What is CodeHub?</h2>
<p>CodeHub is a place to code, share, and learn from one another.  Whether you are an experienced developer or just learning to code, interested in design or programming, you are more than welcome.</p>
<p>We are largely based within a 25 mile radius of Bristol/Bath, but anyone welcome. CodeHub is also a chapter of <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool</a>.</p>
