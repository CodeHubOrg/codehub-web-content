## Events and Activties

Currently, we are running the following events and activities:
- **Bristol Hack Night** is a casual social coding event where people of any experience can come together to work on projects and learn new skills.  It takes place once a fortnight (Tuesday evenings) at [Framework Co-working space](https://www.frameworkbristol.co.uk/) at 35 King Street.
- **WebDev101** is a self-directed study group for everyone interested in improving their knowledge of web development. It meets once a fortnight (Tuesday mornings) at [Dom's Coffee House](https://domscoffeehouse.co.uk/) near the Hippodrome.
- **Python Dojo** is a safe place to practise and develop coding skills, and perhaps learn something new too.  It is held roughly every month (at Framework).
- **Talks** are organised from time to time, based on feedback from members about topics of interest.
- **Mentoring programme:** we organise mentoring programmes which start approximately twice a year for those interested in joining - either as mentors or as mentees.

You can find more information on what we do on [our wiki](https://wiki.codehub.org.uk).

All events are advertised and can be joined via our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/codehub-bristol). Please check out our [Code of Conduct](/code-conduct/).
